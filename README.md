# Quadris

Hello! This project was done by Aaron, Owen, and Jimmy for the S18 term of CS246 at the University of Waterloo. We were able to learn a ton and had a lot of fun while working on this project. This project was originally done on University Gitlab, we decided to migrate to Github later as it's easier to reference. 

## Usage
The game supports following commands:

- "left",  "right", "down", "clockwise", and "counterclockwise" as directional commands

- "drop" drops the current block.

- "levelup" and "leveldown" to change the difficulties of the game.

- "restart" Clears the board and starts a new game.
